# Applications Monitoring

## Kubernetes resources monitoring

Currently, we collect [Kubernetes metrics](../kubernetes/monitoring.md) per node level. More detailed metrics for app instances will be added later.

## Monitoring with third-party service

You can use any third-party service to monitor your app. For example, you can add [NewRelic APM integration](../integrations/newrelic.md).

## Collecting metrics

Services metrics collection is coming soon...
