# Applications Observability

## Monitoring

### Kubernetes resources monitoring

Currently, we collect [Kubernetes metrics](../kubernetes/observability) per node level. More detailed metrics for app instances will be added later.

### Monitoring with third-party service

You can use any third-party service to monitor your app. For example, you can add [NewRelic APM integration](../integrations/newrelic.md).

## Logging

### Live logs

For successfully deployed application you can run live logs streaming to see container's output in the real-time from _Apps > [App] > Logs_ page.

You can find logs of the deployments, builds, cron jobs and actions in associated tasks.

### Persistent storage

Coming soon...
