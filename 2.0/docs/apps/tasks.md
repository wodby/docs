# Application tasks

Applications tasks are the same org-wide tasks but associated with a specific app instance and can be found on _Apps > [App] > Tasks_. Tasks that run for application's sub resources (such as build, deployments, cron jobs) will be associated with the app.

For more details about tasks see [Tasks](../tasks.md).
