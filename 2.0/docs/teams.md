# Team

Teams are the way to group your organization members and manage their access. All organization members added to at least one team. Teams can further be assigned to [projects](projects.md), team members have access to resources inside assigned projects.

Teams have only two roles:

- **Team leader**, they can manage teams
- **Member**
