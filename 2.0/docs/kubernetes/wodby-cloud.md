# Wodby Cloud

If you don't want to bring your own Kubernetes cluster or a server for K3S, you can use Wodby Cloud.

Wodby takes care of clusters deployed to Wodby Cloud and bills you per hour of used compute resources in compute credits. 
One compute credit costs $0.01, we charge separately for:

- Per cluster (to mostly cover just load balancer)
- Cluster node shared CPU core
- Cluster node dedicated CPU core
- Cluster node RAM
- Persistent block storage utilized by apps deployed to the cluster

Wodby Cloud is currently available in two regions: US and EU.

Only organization with a paid subscription can use Wodby Cloud. Paid subscription includes 1000 compute credits per month.
