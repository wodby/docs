# Kubernetes High Availability

## Overview

To ensure high availability of the kubernetes cluster, you need to ensure that the control plane is highly available and have at least two nodes across different availability zones.

[Managed kubernetes](managed.md) services usually provide highly available control plane (for a fee, like GKE, AKS, EKS) or an option to enable high availability for the control plane (DigitalOcean).

Not all managed kubernetes services provide option to use multiple availability zones.
