# Kubernetes

## Creating Kubernetes cluster

We support two different ways of connecting Kubernetes cluster:

### 1. [Managed Kubernetes](managed.md)

Ready-to-run and scalable solutions from [integrations](../integrations/index.md) like GCP, AWS, Azure, DigitalOcean and OVH.

If you plan to scale your cluster and need more flexibility, we recommend this approach.

### 2. [Self-hosted Kubernetes with K3S](k3s.md)

If you want to save money and have more control over your cluster, you can deploy a self-hosted Kubernetes cluster using K3S.

## Demo

Additionally, for testing purposes we provide an option to spin-up a [Demo Kubernetes cluster](demo.md). The cluster is temporary and will be destroyed in 12 hours with all applications.
