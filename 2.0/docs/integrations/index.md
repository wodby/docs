# Integrations

Wodby provides native integration with third-party services through [providers](providers.md). _Integration_ represents a single connection between your Wodby account with your third-party service account. For example, you create a new integration of the AWS provider to connect your AWS account to Wodby to e.g. create a new EKS cluster.

## Provider

Apart from [variable](variable.md) type providers, all providers offered and maintained by Wodby. If you think there's a good provider that we should add to Wodby, please let us know. 

## Types

Every provider can have multiple [integration types](types.md) it offers. When you create a new integration you can select which type you want to create.
