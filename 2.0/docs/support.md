# Getting Support

We have three levels of support

## 1. Community support

Ask Wodby community:

- On Slack https://slack.wodby.com
- On Discord https://discord.wodby.com
- Submit an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/wodby) in a relevant repository

## 2. Best effort support

We provide the best effort support for paid customers with no guaranteed reply time despite how urgent it is. We usually respond in EU business hours and try to give initial responses within one business week.

You can contact us in one of these ways:

* Contact us using a live chat (widget in the right bottom corner) or email us to support [at] wodby.com
* For non-technical questions email us at hello [at] wodby.com

!!! failure "Cannot see live chat widget?"
You may not see live chat support widget if you have tracking protection enabled in your browser

## 3. Premium support

We also provide premium support with guaranteed response time in a private slack channel for the entire organization. The price depends on the size of the organization and number of applications. If you're interested please contact us at hello [at] wodby.com
