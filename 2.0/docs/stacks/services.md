# Stack services

Stack service is a representation of a [service](../services/index.md) in a stack. A stack service always reference a specific revision of a service. In a deployed app an [app service](../apps/services.md) corresponds to a specific stack service.

Stack service allows you to [configure](configuration.md#stack-services) a service on stack level.
