# Service settings

Service setting is the representation of a service configuration which is important and can be changed. Such settings will be shown on the new application create form. Also, settings can be reused in other services that link to a service with settings. Normally, a setting will produce an environment variable with a specified value (a setting can have a default value). 

Service settings defined under [`settings` section](template.md#settings) in a service template.
