# Service configs

Service can define configs that represent configuration files that can be mounted to a path and overridden by a user in on stack or app level.

The difference from [settings](settings.md) is that configs usually used to drastically change configuration of a service, while settings are used to change one setting via environment variables. 

Service configs defined under [`configs` section](template.md#configs) in a service template.
