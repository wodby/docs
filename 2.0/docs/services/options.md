# Service options

Options are used to represent different versions or deployment types of a service. There could be multiple options for a service, and one of them can be marked as default. Options can also have an End of Life (EOL) date, which indicates when the option will no longer get updates from its upstream. 

Service options defined under [`options` section](template.md#options) in a service template.
