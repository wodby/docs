# Project

Projects is a way to group and isolate resources inside your [organization](org.md). Projects have [teams](teams.md) assigned to them. Organization members that are part of the team assigned to a project have access to its resources. In Wodby Dashboard, you can limit displayed resources by the project selected in the header.  

Further, when you create a new resource (e.g. application or integration), you choose which project it's assigned to. You can later share it with more projects. Resources from different projects inside an organization cannot refer to each other, i.e. you cannot deploy an app to a cluster from another project.
