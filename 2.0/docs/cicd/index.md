# CI/CD

Wodby provides the built-in [Wodby CI](wodby-ci.md) to build, release and deploy your images stacks. Alternatively, you can use your own CI/CD system to build and push images to Wodby registry, for more see [CI integrations](../integrations/index.md#ci). Both approaches utilize Wodby CLI to build, release and deploy images.

For storing Docker images we provide [Wodby Registry](wodby-registry.md), but you can also use your own registry such as Docker Hub, for more see [Docker registry integrations](../integrations/index.md#docker-registry).
