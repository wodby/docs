# Continuous Deployments

This page covers deployments triggered by CI system, usually by `wodby ci deploy` command. For more information about deployments see [app deploys](../apps/deploys.md)

All deployments on Wodby are numbered similarly to builds. You can find all deployments history (including failed ones) in the Deployments tab of your app instance.

When you run `wodby ci deploy` you can optionally skip running post-deployments scripts with `--skip-post-deploy` flag.
