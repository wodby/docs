# Getting Support

We provide the best effort support (with exception to premium support customers), this means we do not guarantee that we will respond shortly to your request despite how urgent it is. We usually respond in EU business hours and try to give initial responses within one business day.  

You can contact us in one of these ways:

* Contact us using a live chat (widget in the right bottom corner) or email us to support [at] wodby.com
* For non-technical questions email us to hello [at] wodby.com
* Submit an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/wodby) in a relevant repository

!!! failure "Cannot see live chat widget?"
    You may not see live chat support widget if you have tracking protection enabled in your browser 

We do not provide support for local environment setup (docker4x projects) unless you have a premium support package, but you can ask the community on [Slack](https://slack.wodby.com) or [Discord](https://discord.wodby.com) or submit an issue on GitHub.
