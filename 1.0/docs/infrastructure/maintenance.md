# Infrastructure maintenance

We constantly improve the infrastructure we deploy to our customers' servers. You can see the version of the infrastructure deployed to your server in the Dashboard on the servers list page. It's not always possible to update the infrastructure automatically so if you want update your infrastructure please [contact our support team](../support.md) to schedule the upgrade. 

!!! success "Supported version"
    Currently supported infrastructure version is [6.0.0+](#600)

You will be notified each time a new version of the infrastructure is released.

!!! tldr "Stacks and infrastructure maintained separately"
    For stacks maintenance see [this article](../stacks/maintenance.md) 

## OS upgrade tips

!!! tip "Create snapshot of your VM first"
    Before performing the upgrade regardless of the method we strongly recommend creating a snapshot of your server if it's a VM.    

!!! warning "Test your upgrades with the dev server first"
    Make sure your prod and dev server are from the same cloud provider and have the same OS distribution/version. After successfully upgrading the dev server and testing all the hosted apps you should continue to upgrading your production server.

When you're upgrading your OS to a new major version make sure to:

1. [Stop kube and docker services at first](cli.md#restart-docker-and-kube-services)
2. Perform the upgrade
3. Reboot
4. Make sure Docker was not installed from packages (we require a specific version that we manuall install during server connection)
5. Check iptables version via `iptables --version`. If it's `1.8.2` or newer switch it to legacy mode: `update-alternatives --set iptables /usr/sbin/iptables-legacy`
6. Make sure [cgroup2 disabled](#manual-update-to-os-with-cgroup2-enabled)

## Manual update to OS with cgroup2 enabled

Some OS like Debian 11 have `cgroup2` enabled that not currently supported by the docker version we use, so if you upgrade to Debian 11, you should disable `cgroup2`:
- Edit `/etc/default/grub` and add `systemd.unified_cgroup_hierarchy=0` to `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT` (or `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX` if it's not present)
- Run `update-grub`
- Reboot the server
