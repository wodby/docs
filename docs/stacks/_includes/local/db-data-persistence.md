!!! warning "Database data persistence"
    By default Docker will create a persistent [volume](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) for your DB data and unless you explicitly remove volumes the files will not be deleted. However, if you run `docker-compose down` (it's ok to use `stop` though) these volumes will not be reattached when you run `docker-compose up`. If you want to have your DB data all-time persistent and attached, we recommend using [a bind mount](https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/). To use a bind mount uncomment to corresponding line under db server's `volumes:` in your `docker-compose.yml` and update the host path to your data directory.
