If Mailhog service enabled and chosen as _Mail delivery service_ at `[Instance] > Stack > Settings` all outbound email will be caught by the Mailhog. You can view and release these emails from Mailhog UI, the URL can be found from Domains tab. When release specify `opensmtpd` in `SMTP server` field if you want to release emails to the default Mail transfer agent ([OpenSMTPD](../../opensmtpd/index.md)).
