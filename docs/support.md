!!! info "Support response time"
    We provide best effort support (with exception of premium support customers), this means we do not guarantee that we will respond shortly to your request despite how urgent it is. We usually respond in EU business hours and try to give initial responses within a one business day.  

!!! failure "Missing live chat?"
    You may not see live chat support widget if you have tracking protection enabled in your browser 
    
!!! question "Have a question about local environment?"
    We do not provide support for local environment via live chat (unless you have a premium support package) but you can ask the community on Slack or submit an issue on GitHub
